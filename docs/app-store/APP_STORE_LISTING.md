### Description (4,000 char limit)

```
OpenBixel is a native pixel-art and 2D game-asset studio for Mac — draw, animate, and build tilemaps in one focused workspace.

DRAW & ANIMATE
• Layered raster editor with brush, eraser, fill, line, rectangle, ellipse and eyedropper tools
• Frame-by-frame animation timeline with tags, onion skinning and loop modes
• Palette management with built-in DB32, PICO-8 and Game Boy presets, plus custom palettes
• Undo/redo, clipboard, flip/rotate and nearest-neighbour zoom

TILEMAP DESIGNER
• Paint, flood-fill, pattern and autotile tools for top-down and side-scroller maps
• Structural validation and continuity checks before export
• Export to Tiled JSON, CSV and PNG

AI ASSISTANT
• Built-in assistant that turns prompts into pixel art and spritesheets
• Predict the next animation frame, compress palettes and remove backgrounds
• Connect OpenRouter or custom API keys; keys stay securely in the macOS Keychain

BUILT FOR THE MAC
• Native SwiftUI + Metal, fast and fully offline for everything except AI actions
• Projects autosave locally; your art never leaves your Mac unless you ask the AI to use it

Whether you're prototyping a game jam or shipping a full tileset, OpenBixel keeps the whole pixel pipeline in one place.

## 6. Screenshots (macOS)

At least **one** size is required; provide both for the best result:

| Size | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1280 × 800 | Yes (one of these) | Minimum accepted macOS screenshot. |
| 1440 × 900 | Recommended | |
| 2560 × 1600 | Recommended | Retina. |
| 2880 × 1800 | Optional | |

Suggested shots (3–5):

1. Canvas with the timeline and a running animation.
2. Tilemap Designer with the tile palette and a painted map.
3. AI assistant panel generating a spritesheet.
4. Palette / colour tools.
5. Project library.

Screenshots must show the real UI — no device frames required on macOS. App
previews (video) are optional.

## 7. App Review Information

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Sign-in required? | **No** |
| Demo account | Not required. The AI features need an OpenRouter API key, which reviewers supply themselves; all non-AI features work offline. |
| Contact | Your name, email, phone **(your choice)** |

### Notes for the reviewer

```
OpenBixel is a fully local pixel-art editor. No account is required and all
drawing, animation and tilemap features work offline.

The optional AI assistant requires the reviewer to connect an OpenRouter API key;
without one, the AI panel shows a connection prompt and the rest of the app is
unaffected.

All projects are stored locally under the app container. The app does not collect
analytics.

The Devices pane provides an optional Mac host for the paired OpenBixel iPad app.
To test it, open Settings → Devices, enable “Remote Access,” and choose “Show
pairing code.” When enabled, OpenBixel creates a Network.framework `NWListener` and
advertises the Bonjour service `_bixel-remote._tcp` so a paired iPad can initiate
encrypted local-network connections for project sync and the Mac-hosted AI
assistant. The listener is off by default and is only started after the user
enables Remote Access. Outgoing network connections are limited to OpenRouter
and the house ad feed.
```

## 8. Export Compliance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does your app use encryption? | **Yes** (HTTPS to OpenRouter/Codex via the system TLS). |
| Is it exempt? | **Yes** — it uses only standard OS-provided encryption (URLSession/rustls with standard ciphers) and does not implement proprietary cryptography. |
| `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` | `NO` — add to `Info.plist` to skip the prompt on every upload. |

To automate this, add to the `info.properties` block in `project.yml`:

```yaml
ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false
```

## 9. In-App Purchases

The app uses RevenueCat for a lifetime ad-free unlock. Configure it in App Store
Connect before submitting:

| Field | Suggested value |
|---|---|
| Type | Non-Consumable |
| Reference Name | `OpenBixel Lifetime Unlock` |
| Product ID | `bixel_ad_free` **(must match the RevenueCat product)** |
| Price | Tier of your choice |
| Display Name | `Lifetime Unlock` |
| Description | `Unlock OpenBixel forever and remove all ads.` |
| Review screenshot | A screenshot of the in-app purchase screen. |

Link the product to the RevenueCat entitlement/offering and add the IAP to the
app version under **In-App Purchases**.

## 10. Submission checklist

### China mainland storefront

The app includes an optional Codex provider integration and the associated
metadata must not be used for a China mainland submission without confirming
the required local compliance. For the current build, use the storefront
exclusion path:

1. In App Store Connect, open **Pricing and Availability** → **App
   Availability** → **Manage Availability**.
2. Choose **Specific Countries or Regions** and deselect **China mainland**.
3. Confirm the change before submitting the version for review.

If China mainland distribution is required later, prepare a separate
China-compliant release plan with professional legal advice, disable the
restricted provider in that build, and use localized metadata and screenshots
that contain no restricted provider references.
